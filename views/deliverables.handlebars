          <h2>IMAGING DETAILS</h2>
          <p>The museum will be broken up into 'points of interest,' and a Matterport deployment will be conducted at each point.</p>
          <p>Alongside these deployments will be capture of curated "meta-data", which will allow curation of key interest points through animation and HUD.</p>

    <div class="page pagecontent fifthPage">
      <h2>MATTERPORT DETAILS</h2>
      <p>   The Matterport is a virtual reality camera, which uses an array of IR triangulation modules to construct a true 3D model of any space.
</p>
      <p>
          Spacepost is happy to be one of the first Matterport partners offering full 4k-resolution imaging with the brand-new Matterport Pro2.</p>

      <h2>TRAVEL DETAILS</h2>
        <p>
           Spacepost will send an agent to the PTG exhibit to conduct asset capture and development.
        </p>
        <p>
            This process will take 2-3 days at most, and encompasses capture of video, audio, and 3d models.

      <h2>SUMMARY Part 2</h2>
          <p>
            As described in the proposal steps, this process is estimated to be deliverable within a month of start, and have total project cost of $4 - 5 thousand dollars, including expenses.
            </p>
            <p >
   The core deliverable will be a multi-platform virtual reality and 3D tour web-app, which may be embedded within the PTG website... and will be compatible with all modern windows, osx, linux, andrioid, and ios systems.

      <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
      <p> In this document we explore a possible road map towards the design, construction, and distribution of a VR PTG museum interactive experience. This roadmap is broken up into three steps, which can be summarized as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span>Imaging: </span>Travel to and asset capture of the piano technican guild museum as a series of fully 4k VR capable 3d models, one imaging per point of interest.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Stitching: </span>Construction of a complete spatial model through stitching of the point of interest models.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Interactivity: </span> Design and deployment of a fully explorable VR app, with interactivity layers including per-exhibit information (in H.U.D. form), animated/dynamic exhibits, and narration/music audio layering.
        </li>
      </ul>
